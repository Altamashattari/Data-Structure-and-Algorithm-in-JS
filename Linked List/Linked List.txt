 - A Linked List is a data structure in which each node points to another node.
 - Unlike Arrays which have a fixed size, a linked list is a dynamic data structure that can allocate memory at runtime.
 - Type Types of Linked List:
    - Singly Linked Lists: 
        Each node has reference to the next node.
        A Node in a singly linked list has following properties:
            - data and next.data is the value for the linked list node
            - next is a pointer to another instance of SinglyLinkedListNode
